This is a personal project created by Abrar Zarif. It takes a dataset of various heart disease-related parameters of patients and creates an end-to-end machine learning pipeline. This project includes EDA, preprocessing, feature engineering, modeling, tuning and prediction. The model is then pickled and a RESTful API is created to deploy it. Finally, the model is contained using Docker for deployment. 
The input is the physiological parameters of a patient, and the output is the prediction of them having heart disease.
